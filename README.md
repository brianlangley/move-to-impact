## Project Information

**What is the Deep Dive?**
> The Deep Dive is a week long challange that takes place at the Bit Academy. This challenge gives students an opportunity to put their skills and knowledge to the test by working on real-life projects from actual companies. Over the course of a week, students are tasked with working on complex projects that require them to use their creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. The projects are designed to be both challenging and rewarding, offering students the chance to demonstrate their abilities and gain valuable hands-on experience.

**The Company**
Move Impact is a cutting-edge company that aims to help organizations gain insight into their impact on an economic, social and environmental level. They do this by offering practical programs, tools and templates that guide you towards your next step in the sustainability journey. Examples of outcomes could be becoming a B Corp or CSRD compliant.

**The Team** 
Consisting of Brian, Batuhan, Nick, Emanuel and Christian, we were recently assigned to work on a project for the company Move Impact, founded by Amber Kesselaer. 

**The Task** 
Our team was tasked with redesigning Move Impact's product landing page, Prepare for CSRD. The goal is to make it more user-friendly, engaging, and informative. This was a critical project as the product landing page is the first touchpoint that potential customers have with Move Impact's products; leaving visitors with a good first impression.

## Mission Statement

**Our goal is to create a modern, attractive and engaging user-friendly landing page that showcases this desire and draws in attention for potential customers.**
As a team, we took the time to sit down and discuss all of our brainstorming ideas. We made sure to listen to each and every one of our team members' pitches, carefully considering all of the unique perspectives and insights they brought to the table. After a thorough evaluation of all of the ideas, we were able to highlight and select the key features that we believed would be the most impactful and effective. Through this collaborative effort, we were able to come to a well-informed and thoughtful list of features that will help guide our project to success.

Through this process we came up with the following requisites: 
- **Landing page video highlighting the main features:** A video on the landing page is a great way to immediately engage with potential customers and give them an overview of the product's key features. The video should be short, to the point, and visually appealing, with a clear and concise message. This will help to grab the visitor's attention and keep them interested, while also providing valuable information about the product.
- **Displaying the reviews from customers:** Displaying customer reviews on the webpage can help to build trust and credibility with potential customers. This can be accomplished by including testimonials from satisfied customers, showcasing the product's benefits and how it has helped others. These reviews can be displayed in a variety of ways, such as a review carousel, or in a dedicated section of the site.
- **Adding an attractive and engaging demo section to the webpage:** An engaging demo section can be a great way to allow users to interact with the product and get a feel for how it works. This can be achieved by including an interactive demo that allows users to explore and experiment with different features, or by providing a video demonstration of the product in action. The demo section should be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with clear instructions for users to follow.
- **Individual segmented short articles highlighting important features of the product:** By breaking down the information about the product into short, manageable segments, users can easily digest the information and understand the key features of the product. Each segment should have a catchy header and short descriptive sentence, with a "read more" button that expands the content. This will help to keep the information organized and easy to understand, while also encouraging users to learn more about the product.
- **Implementing animations to the site:** The use of animations can help to bring a site to life, making it more engaging and visually appealing. By using frameworks such as anime.js and GSAP, the team can add smooth, professional animations that will enhance the user experience. These animations can be used to highlight important sections of the site, or to simply add a touch of flair to the design.
- **Changing the design of the footer and adding a clear contact form:** A well-designed footer is an important aspect of any website, as it provides a way for users to quickly access information about the company, such as contact information, social media links, and other important details. By changing the design of the footer and adding a clear contact form, the team can make it easier for users to reach out and get in touch with the company. The form should be easy to use and accessible from any page on the site.
- **A section dedicated entirely to about the product:** A dedicated product section will allow users to learn more about the product and explore its features in greater detail. This section can include interactive demonstrations, videos, and other resources to help users understand the product and how it works. The section should be well-organized and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and helpful resources for users to reference.
- **Removing unnecessary and distracting features:** By removing unnecessary and distracting features, such as small images and lack of universal design, the team can streamline the user experience and make the site easier to navigate. This will help to keep the focus on the key features and information, while also improving the overall look and feel of the site.
- **Increasing the length of the landing page:** By increasing the length of the landing page, the team can provide more space for information and allow each article to have its own dedicated full width and height. This will help to highlight the importance of each feature and provide more space for additional content. The longer landing page will also make it easier for users to navigate
- **A clean, modern, professional design:** A clean and modern design can help to create a professional image for the company and its products. This can be achieved by using a simple color palette, well-designed typography, and a clean layout that is easy to navigate. The design should be consistent throughout the site, with a focus on making information and features easily accessible to users. By taking the time to create a clean and professional design, the team can help to build trust and credibility with potential customers and create a positive user experience.

**The Benefits**
After careful consideration, we have identified a set of key features that will enhance the user experience and better communicate the value of our product to potential customers. These features, including a landing page video, customer reviews, an interactive demo section, informative articles, engaging animations, a redesigned footer with a clear contact form, a dedicated demo section, streamlined user experience, an extended landing page, and a clean, modern, professional design, bring numerous benefits to both the company and potential customers. 

The landing page video will provide a quick and engaging overview of the product's features, while customer reviews will give potential customers a better understanding of the product's value and help to build trust in the company. 

The interactive demo section will allow potential customers to interact with the product and build excitement and interest, while informative articles will provide in-depth information about the product's key features.

The implementation of animations and a clean, modern, professional design will help to create a positive and memorable online experience.

The redesigned footer and dedicated demo section will make it easy for potential customers to get in touch with the company and learn more about the product, while the extended landing page will provide more space for important information and a better user experience.

Overall, these features will help to create a strong and effective online presence for our company and provide potential customers with all the information they need to make an informed purchasing decision.
