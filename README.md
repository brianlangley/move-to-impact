![Move to Impact Logo](https://i.ibb.co/j5yPC5c/logo.png)

This repository contains the code and assets for the Move to Impact website redesign project, undertaken as part of the A Bit Academy school program. The goal of this project is to enhance the user experience and visual appeal of the platform, specifically focusing on the product landing page, "Prepare for CSRD."

## Project Information

**The Deep Dive:** The Deep Dive is a five-day challenge organized by Bit Academy, where students have the opportunity to work on real-life projects from actual companies. The challenge is designed to test students' skills and knowledge, encouraging them to apply their creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. Our team, consisting of Brian, Batuhan, Nick, Emanuel, and Christian, was assigned to work on a project for Move to Impact, a cutting-edge company founded by Amber Kesselaer.

**The Task:** Our team's task is to redesign Move to Impact's product landing page, "Prepare for CSRD." The objective is to create a more user-friendly, engaging, and informative landing page that leaves a positive first impression on potential customers.

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to create a modern, attractive, and engaging landing page that effectively showcases Move to Impact's "Prepare for CSRD" product. The redesigned landing page will focus on drawing attention from potential customers and providing them with a seamless and informative user experience.

To achieve our mission, we have defined the following key features and requisites for the landing page redesign:

- **Landing Page Video:** A visually appealing and concise video that highlights the main features of the product, aiming to engage visitors and provide an overview of its value proposition.
- **Customer Reviews:** Displaying testimonials and reviews from satisfied customers to build trust and credibility with potential customers.
- **Engaging Demo Section:** Incorporating an interactive demo section that allows users to explore and interact with the product, providing a hands-on experience.
- **Segmented Feature Articles:** Breaking down information about the product into short, easy-to-digest segments, with catchy headers and expandable content to encourage further exploration.
- **~~Animations~~:** Incorporating professional and visually appealing animations using frameworks like anime.js and GSAP to enhance the user experience and draw attention to important sections of the website.
- **~~Footer Redesign and Contact Form~~~:** Redesigning the footer section to improve navigation and including a clear and accessible contact form for visitors to reach out to the company.
- **Streamlined User Experience:** Removing unnecessary and distracting features to streamline the user experience and create a cohesive design that focuses on the product's key features and information.
- **Extended Landing Page:** Increasing the length of the landing page to provide more space for information, allowing each feature to have its own dedicated section, and enhancing user navigation.
- **Clean and Modern Design:** Employing a clean and modern design with a simple color palette, well-designed typography, and a layout that emphasizes accessibility and information clarity.

Please note that due to time constraints, we were unable to implement the features of animations and footer redesign with a contact form.
